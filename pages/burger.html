    <p>Smash burgers are formed into balls of ground beef then pressed or smashed with a burger press into a thin patty as soon as they hit the grill. This creates extra browning and flavor on the outside while maintaining the patty’s juiciness.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef - 375g </li>
        <li>Sauce – A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard </li>
        <li>Cheese – thick-sliced medium cheddar</li>
        <li>Buns </li>
        <li>Lettuce </li>
        <li>Pickles </li>
        <li>Tomatoes </li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Patties – Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook</li>
        <li>Make Sauce – Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prep Toppings – fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
        <li>Toast buns – lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</li>
        <li>Cook patties – increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side. </li>
        <li>Add cheese – place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</li>
    </ol>
